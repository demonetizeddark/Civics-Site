                  Welcome to the Statera Party. As a Staterian, we believe in a balanced and ordered nation, and we prioritize as much freedom as possible in what we do as American citizens while staying as humane as possible. "Statera" is the Latin term for "balance" and our slogan is “Legion of freedom.” The United States Constitution was based on the idea of creating a “perfect union”. However, we still had problems when the constitution was first written. Women, persons of color, and citizens who didn’t own land weren’t allowed to vote under the U.S. Constitution. It wasn’t until 1868 that all men were allowed to vote and it wasn’t until 1920 that women were allowed to vote. We believe that people deserve more freedom than that, that all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sex, or religion, should live through the full American experience without being oppressed or opposed by law or discrimination.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em">
                  The Statera Party is committed to protecting the political freedom of all citizens. We understand that there will come an issue where a law cannot fulfill both sides’ desires in a debate, such as abortion laws, and there will be no other way to circumvent the issue without picking one side. In cases like such, we will choose the side that we believe is the right choice based on the severity of the cons against the pros of each choice.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em">
                  Although we believe in the freedom of citizens, we also believe that some rules should be in place to protect the lives of our citizens. Freedom is good, but so is living with that freedom. With all things that we do believe in, we certainly don’t believe in an anarchist society. Some would argue that it would make things a lot easier by not having any rules to settle, but if such were to occur, chaos would ensue and everything would be gone. This is why we push for as much freedom as possible without jeopardizing the lives of innocent people.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em">
                  On the topic of innocent people, we believe the privacy of a person’s browsing on the internet should be exempt from sites collecting unnecessary data without that person’s knowledge, or consent for that matter. We understand that it’s a little off-putting when a website suspiciously collects information that wouldn’t be necessary to use the site properly. TikTok is one example of such occurrences. TikTok has made very dodgy moves when it comes to user data collection, collecting things that would improve the user experience, like videos watched to recommend ones of similar fashion; and collecting things that you would assume the site doesn’t need, like your clipboard in your keyboard (what you have copied).
                </p>
                  <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;font-size: 2rem">
                    Overall, our party is built off the freedom that the majority of citizens were fighting for: peace, order, freedom, and honesty.
