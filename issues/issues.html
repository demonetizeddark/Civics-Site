          <button class="collapsible">Gun Control laws - Deny</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p">The reason that we don’t believe in gun control laws is primarily that they seem to be ineffective, regardless of how strict states make them. It should be made known that if citizens gave up their right to bear arms, the government would have the opportunity to turn against the citizens by taking away all guns or causing government tyranny. Another reason we don’t believe in gun control is that we found that it’s not the gun control laws that deter crime, it’s the gun ownership that deters crime. We found that gun control laws can’t, don’t, and won't do anything at all. Going to our point before, gun ownership had dropped violent crime rates much more dramatically than gun control laws.</p>
              <p>We see that current gun control laws are targeted at poor, black communities because these laws were founded on racial fears. The Statera Party is strongly against discrimination of any kind. We believe that taking away some guns is an infringement of the second amendment and self-defense, as well as denying a sense of safety to U.S. citizens. It would be unnecessary to impose gun control laws when they only make things worse in terms of freedom and safety. The Statera Party is opposing gun control because it conflicts with the freedom to bear arms and self-defense.</p>

          <button class="collapsible">Abortion - Allow</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>This is a choice that not a lot of people will be happy to hear, but we felt that this was the best choice to make based on realistic circumstances. We had come up with different pros and cons that regard pro-choice and pro-life, and we found that the pros of pro-choice outweighed the cons of pro-choice. We believe that the right to abort is fundamental. We say this for several reasons.</p>
              <p>We are pro-choice because there will be circumstances where a family is in an unstable condition to take care of a child. In terms of how we see it, we thought of a circumstance that a random woman happened to be pregnant for whatever reason. If the family is not prepared or not able to take care of the child, then abortion would be justified because the child would otherwise be born into a family that wouldn’t be able to care for basic needs. We would also allow abortion as an option for victims of rape and/or incest.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Same-sex Marriage - Allow</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Same-sex marriage is another topic that we all stand for in the Statera Party. Allowing same-sex marriage means that people can marry who they want to marry without the government stepping in because of the gender one (or both) people being the same. We believe in the constitutional right to license persons of the same sex without otherwise government prevention.</p>
              <p>We also believe that businesses should not discriminate against persons of different sexualities. We believe that no job should be unavailable to people because of their sexuality. We believe that nobody should have to deal with disrespect around the workplace because of their sexuality. Regardless of who you’re married to, everyone should receive equal opportunity.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Smoking Laws - Allow, but restrict access</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Smoking has been a battle amongst the citizens of America for a very long time. It’s another matter where you can only have one or the other. Some people haven’t had any problems with smoking, others can’t say the same. Some people use cigarettes, others use vaporizers. In the United States as a whole, the legal smoking age is 21, but limits of where to smoke vary between states.</p>
              <p>We believe in the current laws of smoking as long as it’s not in an area that forbids smoking. We feel that 21 is a good age requirement for smoking. Nothing to be taken away as (almost) everything is how we feel is right. Smoking should still be forbidden at schools, no-smoking areas in public spaces, and workplaces. We also believe that stores should have a license to sell nicotine products to prevent those said products from getting into the wrong hands.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Economy - Variable Taxes</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>The Statera Party believes in progressive taxes. Progressive taxes are taxes that progressively get higher as a person’s income gets higher. The rich pay more while the poor pay less. That way, this economy can favor the poor and prevent homelessness. Poverty is normally caused by the inability to access productive resources and high costs.</p>
              <p>With this form of taxes, we can solve the problem of poverty much easier by allowing the poor some breathing room to get back on their feet. This can allow for inequalities in the economy to be a lot less of a problem than before. This can prevent the rich from wastefully spending their money and allow the poor to buy more necessities. The money that the rich spend on taxes can be put towards welfare and public services to be of equal and greater value for everyone. The revenue can also be put towards defences and emergency services to help make this country safer.</p>
